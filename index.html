        <p>There are four main formats used in the web: JPG, GIF, PNG and SVG. They're designed for different things. Choosing the right one depending on the purpose is important.</p>

          <h3>The Good:</h3>
          <p>
            JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without increasing file size too much.They're great for photos and images with a lot of gradients in them.
            On the other hand, JPGs do not allow for transparent pixels.
