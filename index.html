        <p>There are four main formats used in the web: JPG, GIF, PNG and SVG. They're designed for different things. Choosing the right one depending on the purpose is important.</p>

          <h2>JPG</h2>
          <p>
            JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without increasing file size too much.They're great for photos and images with a lot of gradients in them.
            On the other hand, JPGs do not allow for transparent pixels.

          <h2>GIF</h2>
          <p>
            GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they’re somewhat limited in terms of color palette—never use them for photos. Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can’t have semi-opaque pixels. This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background. For this reason, it’s usually better to use PNG images if you don’t need animation.
