# practice-imageFormats
A simple static web page that explains the differences between image formats. (png, jpg, svg, gif)


Mindset:
The purpose of this simple assignment is to put into practice what I'm learning about HTML.

To make the experience worth while, the content of the webpage will also be HTML related.

For this assignment, I will focus on...

-making short, informative commit messages
-file structure, organization
-linking to other areas of site
